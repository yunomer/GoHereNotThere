# Go Here Not There

This is a React Application that uses GoogleAPIs and RapidAPIs to inform users of Resturants, Hotels & Attractions around them worth going to. The user shares their location with the browser that then loads the appropriate information. Users can search for places using the Google search bar located at the top right side, and sort the results by ratings.
